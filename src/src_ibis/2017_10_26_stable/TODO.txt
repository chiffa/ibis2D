x provide coord files for paul and zaki
x add boundary area and circumference to results
x diagnostic plots include image
x boundary plotted similar to image
x add scale to results, scale = pixels per xy unit
x change k14 files to end in k14 (rather that k14 in the middle)
x center at k=0 (boundary center of mass rather than area center of mass)
x normalize to unit radius, power for k=1 normalized to 1
x derive normalization for pure circle
x try different normalizations, plot them
x save dict
x pandas?
x thermometer plot day 6, tumor
x add grayscale to thermometer for K14?
x regress K14 vs power + ctn
- make thumbnail panel
- make selection panel with non-selected grayed out
- write the K14 filename to the results table
- make PCA plot with outlines
- write rc files (row_column), 1 unit = 1 pixel
